# -CodeClauseInternship_Gender-and-age-detection-system-
Build a gender and age detection system: Collect diverse image data, preprocess, use pre-trained deep learning model, train specific models, evaluate, integrate into apps, enable real-time inference, post-process for accuracy, optimize, and optionally design a user-friendly interface. Prioritize ethics and regular updates for reliability.
